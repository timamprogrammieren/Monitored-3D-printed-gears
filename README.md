# Monitored 3D printed gears
Tims Fork
 Contains data from a simple experiment with 3D printed gears that are monitored by one infrared track sensor. 

## Specifications

Sensor: HW-511 infrared track sensor

The datasets currently contain data for the following configuration:

Recording resolution: 500 microseconds

12V DC motor running at 1.5V

Microcontroller: Teensy 4.1

Each dataset (csv) uses ";" as delimeter with two colums: column one describes the microcontroller's internal time reference in microseconds; column two captures the digital output of the infrared track sensor.


## Setup

## Gears

Three different center gears were used that are characterized by different levels of wear. The light wear and high wear gears were physically altered in order to surface effects on the overall system performance.

Left to right: no wear, light wear, heavy wear.
